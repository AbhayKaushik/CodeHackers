Project Description
---------------------
The project uses machine-learning algorithms behind the scenes to create a custom teacher, giving questions on the basis of your performance in the given questions, motivating you by giving challenging questions each time as you improve.     

Future Scope
--------------
The project can be scaled to provide other teachers and companies, an online solution for adding the contents and hosting their own classes.
Further expansion can be done in terms of expanding the web app to mobile.
Also the app can be integrated with Dialogflow for visually impaired people
